		<h2>What Character is My Main?</h2>
		<p>I have created several characters in this game, but my main character is my <strong>Jedi Guardian</strong>. This type of character is designated as a tank and in turn has abilities to mitigate damage. Also due to this class type my character has a high health count and very high defense ratings which also cause damage to be reduced. My Characters name is <em>Greklot</em> and his race is a <strong>Sith</strong>. Normally the Sith race is primarily assigned to the Empire side and not to the Republic. When I create a character, I try to make a back story of my own and not go by the norm. When I made this character, I wanted him to be a runaway from his home-world and from the line of empire bound Sith in his family.
